# Item-Profit-Tracker

## Description
I created this project outside of school. I was trying to find items on auctions for cheap and then turn around and sell them for a profit. This gave me the great idea of creating a program to input items and mark them as sold and calculate the net profit on all of these items. I used python to create this application and I was trying to get some experience with using classes. This was my first time creating classes in python, and looking back on it, there were probably many functions I had outside of the classes that should have went inside. I didn't want to change anything before adding this project to GitHub becuase I want it to be a milestone of my programming experience. I know that I still have a lot more to learn but this application turned out to be pretty useful. I also turned it into an executable on my desktop so I would not need to open visual studio every time I tried to add items to the list. This saves all objects to a file and reads them back in everytime the program is executed.
